Keep your torso straight and rigid and your body in a straight line from your ears to your toes with no sagging or bending. This is the neutral spine position. Ensure your shoulders are down, not creeping up toward your ears. Your heels should be over the balls of your feet.\nHold this position for 10 seconds. Release to floor.\nOver time work up to 30, 45, or 60 seconds."

        "description" : "Warrior I is one of yoga's foundational poses, but getting the alignment right can be a little tricky. It teaches you balance and to be more aware of your body positioning. You will recognize the lunge stance as one common for exercise and stretching. Incorporate this pose into a flow as part of a standing yoga sequence.",

        "benefits" : "Warrior I strengthens the legs and upper arms, improves balance and core strength, stretches the muscles around the hips. You get a good stretch of both the front and rear thigh (quadriceps and hamstrings), hips, and chest, as well as a back extension of the erector spinae muscle. It is a hip opener, which is a good antidote for sitting all day. This pose can be therapeutic if you have sciatica. It is also an energizing pose, allowing better breathing and circulation.",
        "variations":"Though Warrior I has traditionally been taught with the heel of the front foot lined up with the arch of the back foot (like standing on a tightrope), it makes more sense for most people to separate their feet to either side of the mat a bit more (like standing on train tracks). This separation allows the hips to square more effectively.",

Your chest stays open as you come into a slight spinal extension (also known as a backbend).\nYour palms can touch overhead or stay shoulder's distance apart, whichever is more comfortable.\nLift your gaze up toward your thumbs and slide your shoulder blades down the back.\nCheck the alignment of your hips. Draw your right hip back and your left hip forward so that both hips are squared to the front of your mat.\nGround down through the outer edge of your left foot. Make sure your right thigh is still as parallel to the floor as possible.\nDrop your hands to your mat and step your right leg back to Downward Dog. Take a few breaths or move through a vinyasa before doing the left side."

Keep both arms parallel to the floor. Release your shoulders away from your ears. Reach out through the fingertips of both hands.\nTurn your head to face the front of your mat. Your gaze is forward over the right hand.\nBoth thighs are rotating outward.\nEngage your triceps to support your arms, your quadriceps to support your legs, and your belly to support your torso.\nAfter 5 to 10 breaths, windmill your hands down to either side of your right foot and step back to downward dog. Stay here for a few breaths or go through a vinyasa before repeating the pose with the left foot forward."
